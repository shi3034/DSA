- logic: if an element appears more than n/2 times it means it appears more than all elements combined. assign an element to 'n'. if the same element
apears again we increment 'count' else decrement. The element appearing more than n/2 times will remain as 'n' after all cancellations.
- we keep a counter variable 'count' and another variable 'n'
- if count=0, assign nums[i] to n.
- if n==nums[i], increment count else decrement
- return n
