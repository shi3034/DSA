APPROACH 1:
create an array of size 26 let's say 'count'
if lengths of two strings are not equal return false
iterate through both the strings in the same loop
for every character in 's' increment the 'count' array as follows: count[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
for every character in 't' increment the 'count' array as follows: count[t.charAt(i) - 'a']--;
iterate through 'count', if any value is !=0 return false
