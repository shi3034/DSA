-we use the bucket sort approach
-create an array of lists, let's say, 'arr' of size n+1 since the maximum frequency can be 'n'. 
-store the frequency of all elements in a hashmap.
-create an array of size 'k' to store the final answer.
-start from the end of 'arr' since we need the most frequent elements first.
-assign each list to a List<Integer> variable. 
-check if the list is empty.
-use a counter variable 'count' to fill the final answer array.
