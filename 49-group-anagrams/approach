Approach 1:
-create a hashmap of string and list of strings
-convert each string to array and sort each of them
-add them to the hashmap according to keys
-return an arraylist of all values of the map

Approach 2:(not always safe for long strings- may result in overflow but is a faster approach)
-create a separate function to get a unique key for every word
-each character is mapped to a prime number and we compare the product of all characters in the word.
-we map the product of characters in the hashmap
